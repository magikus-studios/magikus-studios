                The Machines module offers a suite of dynamic data structures designed to change state over time, simplifying time-based and regularly updated tasks in game development. 
                These structures excel in managing repetitive, state-driven and animated behaviors, allowing developers to focus more on creativity and design rather than the complexities of implementation.

            <p className="pad-left-3">
                The Updater machine efficiently manages recurring tasks in Unity by abstracting update cycles, supporting various update types and allowing modular execution without having to rely on MonoBehaviours.

            <p className="pad-left-3">
                Tween machines provide a powerful and flexible way to animate GameObject properties (like position, rotation, scale and color) over time in Unity, enabling developers to create smooth, professional-grade animations through scripting with minimal effort.

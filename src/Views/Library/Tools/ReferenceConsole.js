                The Reference Console is a powerful tool for managing object references within Unity projects. 
                By providing a detailed view of references and quick access to missing or broken links, it aids developers in maintaining the integrity of their projects. 
                Whether you are working on a small scene or a large-scale project, this tool helps ensure that all references are correctly maintained, contributing to a more stable and efficient development workflow.

            <h3 className="p-2">Introduction</h3>
            <p className="pad-left-2 pad-bottom-2">
                The Reference Console can identify references between objects in the currently open scene and/or all scenes in the project and assets. 
                Additionally, it allows for quick identification of missing references, making it easier to fix issues related to lost or broken links between objects and assets.

            <h3 className="p-2">Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If the automatic refresh option is enabled, the reference list will update whenever the selection changes in the Unity Editor. This can be useful for dynamically tracking references but may impact performance in large projects.</li>
                <li>If a reference is missing, it could be due to an object being deleted or moved. The console helps identify these issues so they can be resolved quickly.</li>
                <li>Scanning all scenes and assets can be time-consuming, especially in large projects. Use the specific modes (Open Scene, Assets) to limit the scope of the search and improve performance.</li>
